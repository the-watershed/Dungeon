# Window Size Update - Character Creator

## Changes Made

The character creator window has been updated to match the exact size and format of the main game window.

## Window Specifications

### Before
- **Size**: 1600x1200 pixels
- **Font sizes**: 24pt (normal), 32pt (title), 18pt (small)
- **Layout**: Spacious with large margins

### After âœ¨
- **Size**: 1000x600 pixels (matches game exactly)
- **Font sizes**: 18pt (normal), 24pt (title), 14pt (small)
- **Layout**: Compact with tighter spacing

## Technical Changes

### `char_gui.py` - Window and Layout Updates

**Window dimensions:**
```python
WINDOW_WIDTH = 1000   # Changed from 1600
WINDOW_HEIGHT = 600   # Changed from 1200
```

**Font sizes (reduced to fit smaller window):**
```python
FONT_SIZE = 18         # Changed from 24
TITLE_FONT_SIZE = 24   # Changed from 32
SMALL_FONT_SIZE = 14   # Changed from 18
```

**Layout adjustments:**
- Title positioned at y=30 (was 50)
- Left margin reduced from 100px to 50px
- Menu instructions shortened and positioned at y=70 (was 100)
- Menu item spacing: 28px (was 35px) or 42px with description (was 55px)
- Max visible menu items: 12 (was 20) to fit 600px height
- Info screen line spacing: 24px (was 30px)
- Input boxes sized 500px wide (was 600px)
- All vertical positions scaled proportionally

## Visual Consistency

Both windows now share:
- âœ… Same size: 1000x600 pixels
- âœ… Same background color: (74, 71, 65) - Dark parchment
- âœ… Same color palette: Light parchment text, gold highlights
- âœ… Same window position: Both centered/placed consistently
- âœ… Seamless transitions: No jarring size changes

## Benefits

1. **Visual Continuity**: Smooth transition between character creator and game
2. **No Window Resizing**: Window stays the same size throughout experience
3. **Consistent Layout**: Same margins and spacing conventions
4. **Better UX**: Users don't need to adjust to different window sizes
5. **Professional Feel**: Polished, unified interface

## Layout Optimizations

To fit content in the smaller window:

### Text and Spacing

- Tightened line spacing (20% tighter)
- Shortened instruction text
- Reduced margins and padding

### Menu System
- Maximum 12 visible items (was 20)
- Tighter item spacing: 28px vs 35px

### Info Screens

### Old Flow (Jarring)
```
Character Creator: 1600x1200
         â†“
    [Window closes]
         â†“
    [Window resizes]
         â†“
   Game Window: 1000x600
```

### New Flow (Seamless) âœ¨
```
Character Creator: 1000x600
         â†“
    [Window closes]
         â†“
    [Window reopens]
         â†“
   Game Window: 1000x600
   (Same size - smooth transition!)
```

## User Experience Impact

**Before**: 
- User sees large character creator window
- Window closes
- Smaller game window opens
- User must adjust mental model and visual focus

**After**:
- User sees character creator at game size
- Window closes
- Game window opens at exact same size
- User's visual focus unchanged
- Professional, polished experience

## Font Readability

Despite smaller font sizes, text remains highly readable:
- **18pt body text** - Very readable for extended reading
- **24pt titles** - Clear and prominent
- **14pt small text** - Readable for instructions
- High contrast text colors ensure clarity
- Parchment color scheme maintains aesthetic

## Future Considerations

If the game window size changes in the future:
1. Update `BASE_WIN_W` and `BASE_WIN_H` in `main.py`
2. Update `WINDOW_WIDTH` and `WINDOW_HEIGHT` in `char_gui.py`
3. Font sizes may need adjustment if window becomes much larger/smaller
4. Layout spacing can be scaled proportionally

## Summary

The character creator now perfectly matches the game window size (1000x600), providing a seamless, professional user experience. All text remains readable, menus function properly, and the transition between character creation and gameplay is smooth and visually consistent.

The unified window size creates a cohesive experience that feels polished and well-designed, eliminating the jarring window size change that existed before.

**Window Size**: âœ… 1000x600 (matches game)
**Color Scheme**: âœ… Parchment theme (matches game)
**Layout**: âœ… Compact and efficient
**Readability**: âœ… Excellent
