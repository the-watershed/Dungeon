## Integration with Main Game

### Menu System
- Character Creator option added as first menu item
- Calls `run_character_creator()` when selected
- Pygame window closes and reopens seamlessly
- Returns Character object or None if cancelled

### Status Display
The status panel dynamically shows either:

**With Character Loaded:**
- Character name (highlighted)
- Race and class
- HP (current/max)
- AC and THAC0
- All 6 ability scores on 2 lines
- Gold pieces
- Exploration percentage

**Without Character:**
- Player position
- Dungeon size
- Light radius
- Exploration percentage

### Character Object
```python
class Character:
    name: str
    race: str
    char_class: str
    alignment: str
    level: int
    
    # Abilities
    strength, dexterity, constitution: int
    intelligence, wisdom, charisma: int
    
    # Combat
    max_hp, current_hp: int
    armor_class: int  # Lower is better
    thac0: int  # Attack bonus
    
    # Resources
    gold: int
    xp: int
    equipment: List[str]
    weight_carried: float
    racial_abilities: List[str]
```

## Technical Implementation

### Self-Contained Design
- char_gui.py has no dependencies on char.py (the old terminal version)
- All data structures defined internally
- Complete Character class with save/load methods
- Utility functions (roll_dice, roll_ability_scores)

### GUI Components
- `CharacterCreatorGUI` class manages the entire flow
- Reusable UI methods:
  - `draw_text()` - Render text with colors and alignment
  - `draw_box()` - Draw borders
  - `show_menu()` - Scrollable selection menus
  - `show_info_screen()` - Multi-line displays
  - `get_text_input()` - Text entry with visual feedback

### Event Handling
- Proper Pygame event loop
- Keyboard input (arrow keys, WASD, Enter, Escape, typing)
- 60 FPS for smooth display
- Non-blocking input checks

### Data Persistence
- Characters saved to `saves/<name>.json`
- JSON format with all attributes
- Auto-create saves directory
- Load screen shows existing characters
