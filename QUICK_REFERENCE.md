2. **Save Gold** - Don't spend everything; save for potions and future equipment
3. **Prioritize AC** - Buy the best armor you can afford (Fighter/Cleric/Paladin)
4. **Essential Gear** - Always buy backpack, rope, light source, food, water
5. **Class Match** - Choose race that boosts your class's prime stat
6. **Read Racial Abilities** - Some abilities are very powerful (Infravision, Magic Resistance)
7. **Alignment Matters** - Paladins must be Lawful Good
8. **Equipment Weight** - Track encumbrance (listed in character sheet)
9. **Healing Potions** - Buy at least one if you can afford it
10. **Save Often** - Characters are auto-saved, but save game progress manually
