3. Browse for a sound file (MP3, WAV, MID)
4. Set volume and weight for the new variant
5. Variant is added to the asset

## File Formats

### Supported Input Formats
- **MP3**: Compressed audio (music, effects)
- **WAV**: Uncompressed audio (effects, short sounds)
- **MIDI (.mid)**: Music sequences (smaller file size)
- **OGG**: Compressed audio (effects, music)

### Export Formats
- **MP3**: Exports maintain original MP3 encoding
- **WAV**: Exports maintain original WAV format
- **MIDI**: Exports maintain original MIDI data

## Tips & Best Practices

### Asset Organization
- Use **categories** to group sounds: "ui", "combat", "ambient", "music"
- Add **tags** for easy searching: "click", "explosion", "footstep"
- Use **descriptions** to document usage: "Player melee hit sound for sword attacks"

### Variants
- Use **multiple variants** for variety (e.g., 5 different footstep sounds)
- Adjust **weight** to control frequency (higher = more common)
- Adjust **volume** per-variant for consistent loudness
- Keep **at least one variant** per asset (can't delete the last one)

### Performance
- Enable **stream** for large music files (reduces memory usage)
- Keep **loop** enabled for ambient and music tracks
- Use **MP3** for music (smaller files)
- Use **WAV** for short effects (better quality, instant playback)

### Workflow
- **Preview** sounds before saving to verify they're correct
- **Save often** to avoid losing changes
- Use **Import** to add variants from external sources
- Use **Export** to back up sounds or share with team

## Data Storage

### Files Created
- `sound_library.json`: Metadata manifest (human-readable)
- `sounds.snd`: Packed binary archive (contains all audio data)
- `resources/sounds/`: Individual sound files (imported assets)

### Auto-Save
The UI automatically saves when you exit (Esc or close window).
You can also manually save anytime with the **Save** button or **S** key.

## Troubleshooting

### "Asset already exists" Error
- Asset names must be unique
- Rename the asset when editing if needed

### "Cannot delete last variant"
- Each asset must have at least one variant
- Delete the entire asset instead if needed

### Preview Not Playing
- Check that pygame mixer is initialized
- Verify the sound file exists in resources/sounds/
- Music assets require pressing Space or clicking Preview

### Export Failed
- Ensure variant data is accessible
- Check that storage key exists in archive
- Verify write permissions for target directory

## Advanced Features

### Storage Keys
Each variant has an internal `storage_key` used in the binary archive.
These are automatically managed by the library.

### Procedural Assets
The "procedural" asset type is for generated sounds (not file-based).
These are handled programmatically in code, not via the UI.

### Weight-Based Randomization
When an asset has multiple variants, the library chooses one randomly
based on weight. Higher weight = more likely to play.

**Example:**
- Variant 1: weight 1.0 (50% chance)
- Variant 2: weight 1.0 (50% chance)
- Variant 3: weight 2.0 (twice as likely as others)

## Keyboard-Free Usage

You can operate the entire UI without touching the keyboard:
1. Use mouse to select assets and variants
2. Click buttons for all operations
3. Type in dialog boxes when they appear
4. No need to remember keyboard shortcuts!

Keyboard shortcuts are still available for power users who prefer them.
